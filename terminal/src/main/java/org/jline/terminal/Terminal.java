/**
 * A terminal representing a virtual terminal on the computer.
 *
 * <p>The Terminal interface is the central abstraction in JLine, providing access to the terminal's
 * capabilities, input/output streams, and control functions. It abstracts the differences between
 * various terminal types and operating systems, allowing applications to work consistently across
 * environments.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Terminal Capabilities</h2>
 * <p>Terminals provide access to their capabilities through the {@link #getStringCapability(Capability)},
 * {@link #getBooleanCapability(Capability)}, and {@link #getNumericCapability(Capability)} methods.
 * These capabilities represent the terminal's features and are defined in the terminfo database.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Input and Output</h2>
 * <p>Terminal input can be read using the {@link #reader()} method, which returns a non-blocking reader.
 * Output can be written using the {@link #writer()} method, which returns a print writer. For raw access
 * to the underlying streams, use {@link #input()} and {@link #output()}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Terminal Attributes</h2>
 * <p>Terminal attributes control the behavior of the terminal, such as echo mode, canonical mode, etc.
 * These can be accessed and modified using {@link #getAttributes()} and {@link #setAttributes(Attributes)}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Signal Handling</h2>
 * <p>Terminals can handle various signals, such as CTRL+C (INT), CTRL+\ (QUIT), etc. Signal handlers
 * can be registered using {@link #handle(Signal, SignalHandler)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Signal handling allows terminal applications to respond appropriately to these events,
 * such as gracefully terminating when the user presses Ctrl+C, or adjusting the display
 * when the terminal window is resized.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * Terminal terminal = TerminalBuilder.terminal();
 *
 * // Handle interrupt signal (Ctrl+C)
 * terminal.handle(Signal.INT, signal -> {
 *     terminal.writer().println("\nInterrupted! Press Enter to exit.");
 *     terminal.flush();
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Mouse Support</h2>
 * <p>Some terminals support mouse tracking, which can be enabled using {@link #trackMouse(MouseTracking)}.
 * Mouse events can then be read using {@link #readMouseEvent()}.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>Terminals should be closed by calling the {@link #close()} method when they are no longer needed
 * in order to restore their original state. Failure to close a terminal may leave the terminal in an
 * inconsistent state.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Creating Terminals</h2>
 * <p>Terminals are typically created using the {@link TerminalBuilder} class, which provides a fluent API
 * for configuring and creating terminal instances.</p>
 *
 * @see TerminalBuilder
 * @see Attributes
 * @see Size
 * @see Cursor
 * @see MouseEvent

     * appearance based on whether they are currently in focus.

     * When focus tracking is enabled and supported, the terminal will send special
     * escape sequences to the input stream when focus is gained ("\33[I") or

/**
 * A reader that provides non-blocking read operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * The NonBlockingReader class extends the standard Reader class to provide
 * non-blocking read operations. Unlike standard readers, which block until
 * data is available or the end of the stream is reached, non-blocking readers
 * can be configured to return immediately or after a specified timeout if no
 * data is available.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is particularly useful for terminal applications that need to
 * perform other tasks while waiting for user input, or that need to implement
 * features like input timeouts or polling.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The class defines two special return values:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #EOF} (-1) - Indicates that the end of the stream has been reached</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READ_EXPIRED} (-2) - Indicates that the read operation timed out</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class typically use a separate thread to handle
 * blocking I/O operations, allowing the main thread to continue execution.
 * The {@link #shutdown()} method can be used to terminate this background
 * thread when it is no longer needed.
 * </p>

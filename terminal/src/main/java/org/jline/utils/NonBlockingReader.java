/**
 * A reader that provides non-blocking read operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * The NonBlockingReader class extends the standard Reader class to provide
 * non-blocking read operations. Unlike standard readers, which block until
 * data is available or the end of the stream is reached, non-blocking readers
 * can be configured to return immediately or after a specified timeout if no
 * data is available.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is particularly useful for terminal applications that need to
 * perform other tasks while waiting for user input, or that need to implement
 * features like input timeouts or polling.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The class defines two special return values:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #EOF} (-1) - Indicates that the end of the stream has been reached</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READ_EXPIRED} (-2) - Indicates that the read operation timed out</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this class typically use a separate thread to handle
 * blocking I/O operations, allowing the main thread to continue execution.
 * The {@link #shutdown()} method can be used to terminate this background
 * thread when it is no longer needed.
 * </p>

     * <p>
     * This method terminates the background thread that is used to handle
     * blocking I/O operations. This allows the application to clean up resources
     * and prevent thread leaks when the reader is no longer needed.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Note that if the thread is currently blocked waiting for I/O, it will not
     * actually shut down until the I/O is received or the thread is interrupted.
     * In some implementations, this method may interrupt the thread to force it
     * to shut down immediately.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * After calling this method, the reader should not be used anymore, as
     * subsequent read operations may fail or block indefinitely.

/**
 * An input stream that supports non-blocking read operations with timeouts.
 *
 * <p>
 * The NonBlockingInputStream class extends InputStream to provide non-blocking read
 * operations. Unlike standard input streams, which block indefinitely until data is
 * available or the end of the stream is reached, non-blocking input streams can be
 * configured to return immediately or after a specified timeout if no data is available.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class defines two special return values:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #EOF} (-1) - Indicates that the end of the stream has been reached</li>
 *   <li>{@link #READ_EXPIRED} (-2) - Indicates that the read operation timed out</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This abstract class provides the framework for non-blocking input operations, with
 * concrete implementations handling the details of how the non-blocking behavior is
 * achieved (e.g., through NIO, separate threads, or native methods).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Non-blocking input streams are particularly useful for terminal applications that
 * need to perform other tasks while waiting for user input, or that need to implement
 * features like input timeouts or polling.
 * </p>

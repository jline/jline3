/**
 * Manages the JLine shutdown-hook thread and tasks to execute on shutdown.
 *
 * <p>
 * The ShutdownHooks class provides a centralized mechanism for registering tasks
 * that should be executed when the JVM shuts down. It manages a single shutdown
 * hook thread that executes all registered tasks in the reverse order of their
 * registration.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is particularly useful for terminal applications that need to perform
 * cleanup operations when the application is terminated, such as restoring the
 * terminal to its original state, closing open files, or releasing other resources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Tasks are registered using the {@link #add(Task)} method and can be removed using
 * the {@link #remove(Task)} method. All tasks must implement the {@link Task} interface,
 * which defines a single {@link Task#run()} method that is called when the JVM shuts down.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * // Create a task to restore the terminal on shutdown
 * ShutdownHooks.Task task = ShutdownHooks.add(() -> {
 *     terminal.setAttributes(originalAttributes);
 *     terminal.close();
 * });
 *
 * // Later, if the task is no longer needed
 * ShutdownHooks.remove(task);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @since 2.7

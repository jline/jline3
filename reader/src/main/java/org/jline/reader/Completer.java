 * A completer is the mechanism by which tab-completion candidates will be resolved.
 * <p>
 * Completers are used to provide context-sensitive suggestions when the user presses
 * the tab key while typing a command. They analyze the current input line and generate
 * a list of possible completions based on the context.
 * <p>
 * JLine provides several built-in completers in the {@code org.jline.reader.impl.completer}
 * package and in the {@code org.jline.builtins.Completers} class.
 * <p>
 * Completers can be combined and nested to create sophisticated completion behavior.
 * They are typically registered with a {@link LineReader} using the
 * {@link LineReaderBuilder#completer(Completer)} method.

     * and display attributes that will be used when presenting completion options
     * to the user.

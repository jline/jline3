# Syntax Highlighting

import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/components/CodeSnippet';

JLine provides powerful syntax highlighting capabilities through its `Highlighter` interface. This guide explains how to implement syntax highlighting in your JLine applications.

## Basic Highlighting

The simplest way to add highlighting is to implement the `Highlighter` interface:

<CodeSnippet name="BasicHighlighterExample" />

In this example, all input text is highlighted in blue. The `Highlighter` interface has a single method, `highlight`, which takes the current `LineReader`, the input buffer, and a list of candidates to which the highlighted versions should be added.

## Keyword Highlighting

A more useful example is highlighting specific keywords:

<CodeSnippet name="KeywordHighlighterExample" />

This example uses regular expressions to identify SQL keywords and highlights them in bold blue.

## Full Syntax Highlighting

For more complex languages, you can implement a more sophisticated highlighter:

<CodeSnippet name="SyntaxHighlighterExample" />

This example demonstrates a more complete syntax highlighter for a simple programming language, with different colors for keywords, strings, numbers, and comments.

## Error Highlighting

Highlighters can also be used to indicate errors in the input:

<CodeSnippet name="ErrorHighlightingExample" />

This example checks for balanced parentheses and highlights any unmatched parenthesis with a red background.

## Best Practices

When implementing syntax highlighting in JLine, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Performance**: Highlighting is performed on every keystroke, so keep your implementation efficient.

2. **Incremental Highlighting**: For large inputs, consider implementing incremental highlighting that only processes the changed portions.

3. **Error Resilience**: Your highlighter should handle invalid or incomplete input gracefully.

4. **Color Choices**: Choose colors that work well on both light and dark backgrounds, or adapt based on the terminal's capabilities.

5. **Accessibility**: Don't rely solely on colors for conveying information.

6. **Consistency**: Use consistent highlighting styles for similar elements.

7. **Terminal Capabilities**: Check the terminal's capabilities before using advanced styling features.

8. **Testing**: Test your highlighter with a variety of inputs to ensure it behaves as expected.

Syntax highlighting can significantly improve the usability of your command-line application by making the structure of the input more visible and helping users identify errors more quickly.

# Interactive Features

import CodeSnippet from '@site/src/components/CodeSnippet';

JLine provides several advanced features that enhance the interactive experience of command-line applications. This guide covers some of the most powerful interactive features: PrintAboveWriter, LineReader#printAbove, Status, and Tailtips.

## PrintAboveWriter and LineReader#printAbove

One of JLine's most powerful features is the ability to print text above the current input line. This is particularly useful for displaying asynchronous information (like notifications or progress updates) without disrupting the user's input.

### Using LineReader#printAbove

The simplest way to print above the current line is to use the `printAbove` method of the `LineReader` class:

<CodeSnippet name="PrintAboveExample" />

In this example, notifications will appear above the input line, and the user can continue typing without interruption.

### Using PrintAboveWriter

For more control, you can use the `PrintAboveWriter` class:

<CodeSnippet name="PrintAboveWriterExample" />

The `PrintAboveWriter` class provides a standard `PrintWriter` interface, making it easy to integrate with existing code that expects a `PrintWriter`.

### Best Practices

When using these features, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Use sparingly**: Too many messages can be distracting.
2. **Keep messages concise**: Long messages may wrap and take up too much screen space.
3. **Consider styling**: Use colors and styles to differentiate types of messages.
4. **Flush the writer**: Always call `flush()` after writing to ensure the message is displayed immediately.
5. **Thread safety**: Access to the terminal should be synchronized if multiple threads are writing to it.

## Status Line

JLine's Status feature allows you to display persistent status information at the bottom of the terminal. This is useful for showing application state, connection status, or other contextual information.

### Basic Status Usage

<CodeSnippet name="StatusExample" />

### Dynamic Status Updates

You can update the status line dynamically to reflect changes in your application's state:

<CodeSnippet name="DynamicStatusExample" />

### Status with Multiple Segments

You can create a more complex status line with multiple segments:

<CodeSnippet name="MultiSegmentStatusExample" />

## Best Practices

When using these interactive features, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. **Consistency**: Use consistent styling and positioning for similar types of information.
2. **Clarity**: Make sure the information is clear and concise.
3. **Performance**: Update the status and tailtips only when necessary to avoid performance issues.
4. **Accessibility**: Don't rely solely on colors for conveying information.
5. **Thread safety**: Synchronize access to shared resources when updating from multiple threads.

These interactive features can significantly enhance the user experience of your command-line application, making it more informative and responsive.

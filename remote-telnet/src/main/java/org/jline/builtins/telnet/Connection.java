/**
 * Class that implements a connection with this telnet daemon.
 * <p>
 * It is derived from java.lang.Thread, which reflects the architecture
 * constraint of one thread per connection. This might seem a waste of
 * resources, but as a matter of fact sharing threads would require a
 * far more complex imlementation, due to the fact that telnet is not a
 * stateless protocol (i.e. alive throughout a session of multiple requests
 * and responses).
 * <p>
 * Each Connection instance is created by the listeners ConnectionManager
 * instance, making it part of a threadgroup and passing in an associated
 * ConnectionData instance, that holds vital information about the connection.
 * Be sure to take a look at their documention.
 * <p>
 * Once the thread has started and is running, it will get a login
 * shell instance from the ShellManager and run passing its own reference.
